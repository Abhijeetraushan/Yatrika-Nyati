The best time to visit India depends on the kind of experience you are looking for. The diverse topography enjoys diverse weather conditions. If you would want to bask in summer then there are places with year-long tropical weather conditions. If snow, cold and soothing climate suits you then there are locales with winter weather, especially the lap of the Himalayas.

To put at ease your concerns of when to go in India, the country can only be properly explained as a year-round destination.</p>
